# OpenForum
## About
OpenForum is an in-development simple, user-friendly forum software written in PHP and MySQL.

## Installation
1. Ensure that you have both MySQL and PHP5+ installed.
2. You can download the repository directly from the site or use `git clone https://github.com/zacharyvincze/OpenForum` to clone it.
3. Import the database schematic into your database using phpMyAdmin, MySQLWorkbench or whatever you choose to use.  The schematic file is currently called `schema.sql` and should be updated with the server's newest additions.
4. Setup the configuration file.  Details about this will be in the setup section of the [wiki](https://github.com/zacharyvincze/OpenForum/wiki/Quick-Start).
5. Host the site in the document root, which is `public_html` by default.  You can use PHP5's built in web server to test if your configuration is working first using `php -S localhost:8000` and navigating to the index page on the site.

Congratulations, if you've gotten this far, you have successfully set up the site!
